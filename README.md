# Sorting
Implementation of the most popular sorting algorithms for unsigned integers in C++

## My order of learning these algorithms:-
1. Merge Sort
2. Quick Sort
3. Bubble Sort
4. Selection Sort
5. Insertion Sort
6. Shell Sort
7. Counting Sort
8. Bucket Sort
9. Radix Sort (LS)
10. Heap Sort

## Things to explore in future:-
1. Radix Sort (MS) for strings
2. Other sorting algorithms appropriate for strings
3. Signed integer sorting algorithms
4. Float (real numbers/rational numbers) sorting algorithms
5. Object sorting algorithms
